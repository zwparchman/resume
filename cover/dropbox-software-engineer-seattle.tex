I am applying for your `Software Engineer - Seattle' opening
advertised on the Dropbox website. 
My attached resume contains my qualifications, and experience.

I think that pushing the boundaries of software such as Dropbox has done
presents interesting challenges and opportunities that I would like to be a
part of. In particular both the reverse engineering of OSX's finder and the
custom bitmap caches mentioned in the job posting sound very interesting.  I
expect my BS degree in Computer Science, experience working on large machines,
and desire to work as part of a team will be valuable to Dropbox.

Please see my resume for additional information on my experience.  I can be
reached anytime via email at \email{} or my cell phone,
\phone{} Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to
speaking with you about this employment opportunity.

\noindent
Sincerely,\\
