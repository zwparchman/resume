If you are interested in this kind of stuff I'd be more than happy to talk 
about it at some point, but like I said I don't expect it to be useful to 
someone in your line of work unless you have a need to automate document
creation or submit research papers.

the short version is:

- res.cls contains high level formating data.

- resume.tex contains the content and some instructions on how exactly to 
display stuff that the defaults from res.cls weren't good enough for
