    I have experience programming for Linux and Windows systems varying in size from super computers to embedded devices. 
    I also have experience working directly with customers to define and refine system requirements.
    I have taken trips to customer facilities to install software projects both with and without support.
    I have worked with my coworkers to develop new abstractions to allow us to do our job more quickly and accurately.

\section{Experience}
\job{Software Developer} 
{March 2018 - Present} 
{Quality Manufacturing Systems Incorporated}
{La Vergne Tennessee}
{
    I have designed and implement software for automated pharmacies. This
    software includes real time  control software, web services, and database
    update applications in both the handheld and desktop variety  used by the
    line workers.  To develop this software I have worked closely with our
    customers to define the requirements for these
    systems and find potential short comings of the defined solutions.
    Installation of this software often requires on site
    installation trips to install, test, and debug software
    changes often while the production line is in use. The longest of such
    trips I was involved in was seven days. I am also responsible
    for providing emergency support if there is an event that causes the
    production line to shutdown no matter the time of day.

    This effort resulted in multiple scientific papers and patents.
}

\job{Research Programmer Intern} 
{May 2015 - August 2015}
{Oak Ridge National Laboratory / ORISE}
